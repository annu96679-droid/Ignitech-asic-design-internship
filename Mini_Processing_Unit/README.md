# Mini Processing Unit (MPU) – Verilog Based Custom Micro-Architecture

This project implements a fully-functional Mini Processing Unit (MPU) designed using Verilog HDL. The MPU follows a modular micro-architecture inspired by basic RISC processors and consists of independent, reusable RTL blocks such as the Program Counter, Instruction Memory, Instruction Register, Register File, ALU, Control Unit (FSM), and Data Memory.

The design supports arithmetic operations, logical operations, shift/rotate functions, branching, comparison, immediate execution, and state-based control sequencing. It is suitable for learning Digital Design, RTL Architecture, Computer Organization, and Backend VLSI Physical Design flows (RTL → GDS).
